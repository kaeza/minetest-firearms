Firearms Mod for Minetest
Copyright (c) 2013, Diego Mart√≠nez

This mod adds several firearms to the game. Currently included are a .45
handgun, a shotgun, an assault rifle, and a grenade launcher.

The mod also exports an API to easily define new weapons from other mods.
See the `firearmslib.lua' for details, and `guns.lua' for some examples.

This mod uses parts from PilzAdam's TNT mod.
